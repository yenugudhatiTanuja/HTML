    <h1>WHO</h1>
    <section>
        <p>The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of 
            smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities 
            include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable
             diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and 
             substance abuse. The agency advocates for universal health care coverage, engagement with the monitoring of public
              health risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting health and well-being generally.</p>
